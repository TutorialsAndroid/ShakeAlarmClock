Tired of pressing the power button/swiping the screen every time an alarm rings? Does your phone's UI have a tendency to freeze, thereby making it impossible to dismiss an alarm? No worries! You have come to the right place. With this app, you can simply shake your phone and dismiss the alarm.


## Salient features:
1. The alarm is handled by a service which has almost no dependency with the UI. So, even if your UI freezes, the alarm will ring and can be dismissed.
1. Uses latest Android Room database for storing alarms.
1. Inbuilt dark theme, even in phones that do not support it.

## How to use?
Simply download the latest apk file, install it and you are all set!
