# Shake Alarm Clock

## Privacy policy:

The Shake Alarm Clock app is an open source Android app developed by Wrichik Basu. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As far as my knowledge extends, I have not programmed this app to collect any personal data. All data created by the user is stored on the user's device and not transported to any server without the user's consent. The only data that is collected is the version of the app installed, and that is done by a third party open-source library (available on GitHub: javiersantos/AppUpdater) for checking whether a newer version of the app is available. This library simply notifies the user when a newer version of the app is available.

If anyone finds any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, please send me an email, and I will surely try to fix it.

As an Android user, I do not like apps collecting my data, and I have made my app such that it collects no sensitive data.

Yours sincerely,
Wrichik Basu.
Kolkata, India.
